# Reimplementation of ICRA and SGVFinder

This code is designed to re-run the analysis performed by Zeevi *et al.* 2019
"Structural variation in the gut microbiome associates with host health". 
See [SGVFinder](https://github.com/segalab/SGVFinder/blob/master/README.md) 
for original code bank and instructions for requirements.

We have added an `environment.yml` to the `SGVFinder` directory which creates a
conda environment, downloads the proper version of python (2.7.8), and the 
python package requirments specified from the code bank linked above.
